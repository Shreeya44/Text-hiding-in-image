# Image Steganography using Python
This project implements Image Steganography, a technique to encode and decode secret messages within images using Python. The project uses OpenCV and Pillow for image processing and manipulation, allowing users to hide and retrieve data in a simple and user-friendly manner.

## Features
Encoding: Hide a secret message within an image by modifying the least significant bits of its pixel values. \
Decoding: Retrieve the hidden message from an encoded image. \
Supports any image format compatible with OpenCV (e.g., .png, .jpg). 

## Technologies Used
Python 3.x \
Libraries: \
OpenCV \
NumPy  \
Pillow (PIL)   \
IPython (for notebook environments)

 ## How It Works
Message to Binary Conversion: Converts the input text to binary format. \
Encoding: Modifies the least significant bits of pixel values to embed the binary message. \
Decoding: Extracts the binary data from the image and reconstructs the original message.

## Advantages of Image Steganography
Data Security:Protects sensitive information by embedding it within images, making the data less noticeable to unauthorized individuals. \
Easy to Implement:The project uses widely available Python libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, and Pillow, making it accessible for developers. \
Supports Various Image Formats:Compatible with common image formats like .png and .jpg, ensuring flexibility for users. \
Efficient Encoding and Decoding:Utilizes the least significant bit (LSB) method, which is lightweight and effective for hiding messages without significantly altering the image quality. \
Customizable:The script can be easily adapted or extended to handle larger messages or provide additional encryption for enhanced security.

## Use Cases
Can be applied in scenarios like secure communication, watermarking, or embedding metadata in digital images.
